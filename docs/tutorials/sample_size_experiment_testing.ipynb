    "### Random Forest (RF) vs. Deep Networks (DN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest is inherently a non-parametric model, meaning that the algorithm requires no assumptions about the data distribution. With infinitely many trees and n -> $\\infty$, RF will follow non-parametric behavior and will guarantee convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Networks with a fixed architecture are entirely parametric. As presented by [Vogelstein, et al. (2020)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.068460v1), there is a clear bias variance tradeoff between DNs as the number of parameters change. This is evident by testing each model over a range of sample sizes. DNs (CNNs) perform particularly well on image datasets. \n",

    "### Experiment Discription\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Vogelstein, et al. (2020)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.068460v1), when trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, both a simple DN and an overparametrized DN produced a lower classification error than RF for sample sizes greater than 2500. RF outperformed both DNs for sample sizes smaller than 2500. While this experiment only tests up to 10000 sample sizes, RF is theoretically guaranteed to produce a lower classification error at infinite samples due to its non-parametric nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to identify a joint distribution (X,Y) that demonstrates this relationship. RF should profuce a smaller generalization error as small sample sizes, a specific parametric DN should produce a smaller generalization error at medium sample sizes, and RF should once again produce a smaller generalization error at large sample sizes."
